## Agile methodolgy

Before I began coding my project, I set up an Issues template in GitHub and linked it with a board for user stories. In addition, labels and milestones were created ensure my project work was planned accordingly based on the time I had to finish and submit the work.

User stories were added to sprints to allow me to focus on sections of work at a particular time. Allowing me to work out a good pace to complete work.

As things occurred during the project, other items would be introduced and re-prioritised, enforcing the agile methodology of working.

![An image of Agile Method](readmedocs/screenshots/agile.png)

### User Stories & Epics

To effectively plan the project's development, I created user stories and assigned them to specific sprints. This ensured tasks were tackled at the right time, allowing for a structured workflow leading up to the submission deadline.

Each user story was linked to a milestone, enabling a detailed breakdown of tasks within their respective EPIC categories.

## Site Design

The initial design was influenced by the Code Institute Boutique Ado walkthrough; however, I incorporated various styling modifications to enhance both the UI and UX, making it unique. The navigation bar and footer are consistently displayed across all pages, along with the search bar. A uniform color scheme, buttons, text styling, and shadow boxes ensure a cohesive look and feel.

Sweet Bite offers a visually appealing experience with a clean white background complemented by rich dark brown accents. The integration of Font Awesome icons throughout the site further enhances the user experience by adding engaging visual elements.

### Wireframes

I designed wireframes to outline the layout and structure of various pages, helping to visualize their appearance and functionality. Additionally, I planned the URL setup in advance to ensure a well-organized site structure before beginning the coding process.

- Home page wireframe

![Wireframe 1](readmedocs/screenshots/wireframe1.png)

- Products page wireframe

![Wireframe 2](readmedocs/screenshots/wireframe2.png)

- Product detail wireframe

![Wireframe 3](readmedocs/screenshots/wireframe3.png)

- Product management wireframe

![Wireframe 4](readmedocs/screenshots/wireframe4.png)

### Database Scheme

An entity relationship diagram was designed using [DBdiagram](https://dbdiagram.io/d/66a404f48b4bb5230e7997fd) to illustrate the structure of each model and their relationships within the database.

![ERD](readmedocs/screenshots/db.png)


## Features

### Navbar
The navigation bar is present on all pages, ensuring seamless access and easy navigation throughout the site. It features dropdown menus that group related items into sections, helping users find what they need more efficiently.

For tablets and mobile devices, the navigation bar collapses into a more compact format, including a dedicated home link. On larger screens, the site's logo serves as the home button, directing users back to the homepage.

![An image of navbar](readmedocs/screenshots/navbar.png)

### Search bar
The search bar is integrated into the navigation bar, enabling users to search for keywords within product names or descriptions.
If nothing is found based off of their search, the user can see no results

![An image of search bar](readmedocs/screenshots/searchbar.png)

### Homepage/ Subsicriptions
The homepage provides visitors with an overview of the site, making sure they understand its purpose right away.

It also includes a sign-up section where visitors can enter their email to receive updates and special offers from the store.

![An image of home page](readmedocs/screenshots/homepage.png)

### All Products
The "All Products" view displays a list of all available items in the store. Each product includes its image, price, category, and rating, allowing users to review the details before making a selection. Additionally, users have the option to add products to their wishlist for future reference.

![An image of all products page](readmedocs/screenshots/allproducts.png)

The "All Products" dropdown in the navigation menu provides additional options for customers to browse the product list in different ways.

![An image of a dropdown menu](readmedocs/screenshots/allproductslist.png)

500 Internal Server Error – A user-friendly message when unexpected errors occur.

### Messages

Toast messages are displayed across the site to enhance user experience by providing real-time feedback on various actions, as highlighted in other feature sections. These notifications inform users about key events, such as adding items to their bag, logging in or out, receiving order confirmation numbers, entering incorrect search criteria, or completing specific actions.

To improve clarity, these messages are color-coded based on their type, ensuring users can quickly distinguish between success, errors, and other alerts.

![An image of Add to wishlist feature](readmedocs/screenshots/addtowishlist.png)

![An image of Add to bag feature](readmedocs/screenshots/addtobag.png)

### Login/ Logout/ Sign up

The login, logout, and signup pages, along with other AllAuth templates, have been customized to seamlessly match the overall design of the Sweet Bite website.

Users can effortlessly sign up, verify their email addresses, and request password resets, ensuring a smooth and consistent experience throughout the site.

![An image of log in page](readmedocs/screenshots/signin.png)

![An image of Sign up page](readmedocs/screenshots/signup.png)

![An image of Log out page](readmedocs/screenshots/logout.png)

### Color Scheme

This color scheme conveys elegance, sophistication, and a warm, inviting atmosphere, likely inspired by chocolate or coffee themes. The combination of dark tones with white highlights ensures good contrast and visual appeal.

![An image of Color Scheme](readmedocs/screenshots/colorscheme.png)

### Site Security

To enhance security, decorators like @login_required and HttpResponseForbidden were implemented in views to restrict access to certain pages and actions. This prevents unauthorized users from accessing protected content, even if they manipulate URL paths or bypass other security measures.

With these safeguards in place, users attempting to access restricted areas will be shown appropriate messages or redirected to the 403 Forbidden error page.

Example: If a user tries to add a product by entering the correct URL manually, the system will block the action and show an appropriate message, ensuring they cannot perform unauthorized modifications.

![An image of an error message](readmedocs/screenshots/error.png)

## Testing

Site testing can be found in [TESTING.md](https://github.com/HebaAbdulal/Chocolate-shop/TESTING.md)

### Mobile and Tablet

Screenshots of responsive design can be found in the [TESTING.md](https://github.com/HebaAbdulal/Chocolate-shop/TESTING.md)

### Features for future consideration

I was able to implement most of the features I initially planned for the website.

In the future, I’d like to introduce a collection option at checkout. This would let users opt out of delivery by selecting a checkbox, removing the need for delivery details, and allowing them to pick up their items directly from the store.

Additionally, I want to implement full CRUD functionality for all store options. This would enable the store owner to manage inquiries and other tasks directly from the front end, streamlining operations without needing backend access.
